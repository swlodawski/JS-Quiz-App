Approach
First, create a Web page basic structure using HTML tags like buttons and heading for landing page, a button to Start Quiz, and <h1> Geeks for Geeks</h1> tags for heading text. Also, use divs and span for outer body structure along with relevant Class names and IDs.
Style the web page using the class names with CSS properties like font weight for text margins, padding to add space, text-align for alignment, and display type for display styling of individual elements.
In JavaScript, create a function that triggers the Start Quiz. When the user starts the quiz, they will get multiple questions, one after another. When the user validates the answers, they can move on to the next question. There are a series of questions hard-coded in the JavaScript file.
At the end, when all the questions are completed, the user will get a high score page where they can view their score.
Example: This example describes the basic implementation of the Quiz App with Timer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
